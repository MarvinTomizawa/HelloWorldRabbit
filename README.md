# HelloWorldRabbit
Project created to learn a bit more about Rabbitmq, Mediatr, and using docker images/containers

# How to run this project?
Run the required infra using docker-compose up (Put the -d flag after the command to run it detached if you still want to use the console)

Then run Api to publish new messages (See endpoints via localhost:5000/swagger/index.html)

Or you can publish the messages in localhost:15672 using username guest and password guest
